# CPP North C64 Demo - Project Summary

## Project Overview
Created a collection of Commodore 64 applications for the CPP North 2025 keynote presentation, demonstrating both traditional C and modern C++ programming on 8-bit hardware.

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Repository Setup
- Created git repository with complete self-contained build system
- Included both cc65 (C compiler) and Oscar64 (C++ compiler) toolchains
- Set up comprehensive build automation with Makefiles
- Created private GitHub repository: https://github.com/shanselman/cppc64cppnorth

### 2. Four C64 Programs Created
1. **cppnorth.prg** - Simple C version with basic PETSCII maple leaf
2. **cppnorth_deluxe.prg** - Professional C version with reverse video blocks
3. **cppnorth_fixed.prg** - Enhanced C version with improved character handling
4. **cppnorth_cpp.prg** - Modern C++ version with classes and RAII

### 3. Technical Achievements
- **Cross-compilation**: Modern development environment targeting 6502 processor
- **C++ on 8-bit hardware**: Demonstrated classes, RAII, namespaces, and composition
- **Professional graphics**: Used reverse video blocks for solid maple leaf display
- **PETSCII handling**: Proper character set management for C64 display
- **Memory optimization**: All programs fit within C64's 64KB memory constraints

### 4. C++ Features Demonstrated
```cpp
namespace CPPNorth {
    class Screen {
        Screen() { /* RAII initialization */ }
        ~Screen() { /* RAII cleanup */ }
    };
    
    class Conference {
        Screen screen;
        MapleLeaf maple_leaf;
        Frame frame;
    public:
        Conference() : screen(), maple_leaf(14, 4), frame(5, 1, 34, 22) {}
    };
}
```

### 5. Build System Features
- **Self-contained**: All build tools included in repository
- **Automated testing**: `test_build.sh` script verifies all builds
- **Multiple targets**: Separate makefiles for C and C++ compilation
- **Clean builds**: `make clean` and `make clean-tools` options
- **Individual builds**: `make`, `make deluxe`, `make fixed`, `make cpp`

### 6. Documentation Created
- **README.md**: Comprehensive build instructions and project overview
- **BUILD_PROCESS.md**: Detailed technical build documentation
- **CPP_FEATURES.md**: Explanation of C++ features on 8-bit hardware
- **PROJECT_SUMMARY.md**: This summary document

### 7. Version History
- **v0.9**: Initial working versions
- **v1.0**: Complete demo with all four variants
- **v1.1**: Enhanced documentation and build system

## Key User Feedback Moments
1. "do that all for me" - User wanted complete installation automation
2. "why did you remove the tools? How will I build this when I clone in the future" - Critical correction about preserving toolchain
3. "the cpp version is VERY close" - Display issues required character set fixes
4. "make it 2025" - Updated year for current conference
5. "Check that in and tag as 1.0" - Version management request

## Technical Specifications
- **Target**: Commodore 64 (6502 processor, 64KB RAM)
- **Load Address**: $0801 (2049 decimal)
- **Program Size**: 3-4KB compiled
- **Compilers**: cc65 (C to 6502) and Oscar64 (C++ to 6502)
- **Graphics**: PETSCII characters with reverse video blocks
- **Colors**: Red maple leaf, red "C++", black "NORTH", white background

## Build Commands Summary
```bash
# Build all versions
make all

# Build individual versions
make           # Simple C version
make deluxe    # Professional C version
make fixed     # Enhanced C version
make cpp       # C++ version

# Run versions (requires VICE emulator)
make run           # Run simple version
make run-deluxe    # Run deluxe version
make run-fixed     # Run fixed version
make run-cpp       # Run C++ version

# Test all builds
./test_build.sh
```

## VICE Emulator Usage
The user encountered issues running PRG files directly. Working solutions:
1. `x64sc -8 cppnorth_deluxe.prg` (attach as disk)
2. Manual load in emulator: `LOAD"*",8,1` then `RUN`
3. Create disk image: `c1541 -format "cppnorth,1" d64 cppnorth.d64 -write cppnorth_deluxe.prg`

## Project Significance
- Demonstrates C++ versatility across hardware generations
- Shows modern programming paradigms on vintage systems
- Perfect keynote material for C++ conference
- Educational value for cross-compilation and retro computing
- Proof that C++ has been powerful since early days
